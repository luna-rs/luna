/**
 * Represents a contextual receiver for handling various stages of an entityâ€™s death event.
 *
 * The [DeathHookReceiver] class is the entry point for death-handling DSLs, providing
 * stage-specific receivers such as:
 * - [PreDeathReceiver] for pre-death logic
 * - [DeathReceiver] for main death logic
 * - [PostDeathReceiver] for cleanup and respawn logic
 *
 * Each stage is determined by the [DeathStage] enumeration within [MobDeathTask]. Only the corresponding stage
 * block is executed when the current stage matches.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```
 * DeathHookHandler.addPlayerHook(ControllerKeys.SOME_MINIGAME) {
 *     preDeath {
 *         victim.sendMessage("You lose everything!")
 *     }
 *
 *     death {
 *         val removed = removeAll(false)
 *         if(source is Player) {
 *             source.sendMessage("Enjoy the items, champ!")
 *             source.bank.addAll(removed)
 *         }
 *     }
 *
 *     postDeath {
 *         victim.move(RESPAWN_LOCATION)
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @param T The mob type affected by the death event.
 * @property victim The entity that has died.
 * @property source The entity responsible for causing the death.
 * @property stage The current death stage ([DeathStage.PRE_DEATH], [DeathStage.DEATH], [DeathStage.POST_DEATH]).
