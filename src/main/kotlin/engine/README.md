This package defines the Kotlin content runtime layer of the Luna engine. It mostly contains **foundational** 
event listeners that ensure system-layer game functions can run, such as
- Persistent NPC and global item spawning
- Banking and deposit box input
- Trading requests and trade screen input
- Make "x" interfaces
- Destroy item interface
- Mob following
